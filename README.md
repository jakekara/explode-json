# explode-json

Serialize a JSON file to a hierarichal file structure of folders (representing
arrays and objects) and text files (representing all other values).

The rules for serialization may seem fairly intuitive.

All collections (objects and arrays) are serialized into folders. The members of
that object are stored in files or folders that correspond to their index, in
the case of arrays, or their key, in the case of objects.

All non-collection values are written to a ".txt" file.

## Why?

I have a project where something very similar to this type of serialization is
necessary. I couldn't find any example of a tool that does this, which is kind
of surprising. 

## Example

In the example folder, there's a Jupyter Notebook calle Notebook.ipynb, and a
corresponding "notebook-exploded" folder that contains the exploded representation
of this notebook. (Notebooks are JSON files under the hood.)

This example was generated by running:

```bash
python explode_json/tool.py example/notebook.ipynb example/notebook-exploded
```

## TODO

This is just a quick proof of concept. I intend to make this a pip installable
package and also make a de-serializer that goes from a folder back to a single
JSON file.
